Employed Pearson correlation coefficients to screen key variables (e.g., land area, military size, carbon emissions) and constructed a multi-factor collaborative impact analysis framework using OLS and FMOLS linear regression models. Quantified the integrated effects of natural and social factors on national economic development and validated the model‚Äôs predictive performance using machine learning training-test set methods. Published during studies at the University of Toronto, providing a data-driven reference for macroeconomic policy-making."
